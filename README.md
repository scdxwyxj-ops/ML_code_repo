## Research Question

**Topic:** Financial Market Prediction and Risk Assessment

**Dataset Options:**
- Stock Market Data (Yahoo Finance)
- Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Lending Club Data

**Research Questions:**
1. How do different feature engineering approaches (technical indicators vs. sentiment analysis vs. macroeconomic factors) affect stock price movement prediction accuracy?
2. What is the comparative effectiveness of traditional machine learning versus deep learning models for detecting fraudulent transactions across different transaction types?
3. How does the temporal stability of credit risk models vary when trained on different economic periods and tested on subsequent market conditions?
4. To what extent can portfolio optimization be improved by incorporating machine learning-based risk predictions compared to traditional financial metrics?

## Communication Plan

- A WhatsApp group chat serves as the main communication channel for the team.
- Regular meetings are held every weekend via Zoom or WhatsApp.
- Members must:
  - Submit honest status updates in the group chat (progress, obstacles, etc.).
  - Use WhatsApp as the primary channel for updates and inquiries.
  - Respect member schedules (no urgent messages past 10 PM unless agreed).
  - Provide clear expectations for task completion timelines.

---

## Meeting Schedule

- Regular meetings at least once every weekend (between 9:00 AM and 10:00 PM).
- At least three of the four members should attend every meeting.
- No member may miss more than two consecutive meetings unless due to health/personal emergencies.

---

## Decision-Making Process

- Quick/urgent matters: WhatsApp group chat.
- Complex/lengthy issues: Zoom or WhatsApp call.
- All members can voice opinions and concerns.
- If conflicts arise:
  1. Healthy debate and/or voting.
  2. If unresolved, compromise between ideas.

## Work Plan and Timeline

**W9**
- Finalize dataset selection and refine the research question.
- Build the initial preprocessing pipeline.
- Implement baselines (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
- Set up 5-fold cross-validation with fixed random seeds; log metrics.

**W (no class week)**
- Compare models (e.g., SVM and tree variants).
- Run hyperparameter search; record best configurations and rationale.
- Maintain experiment tracking (configs, seeds, results) for reproducibility.

**W10**
- Conduct error analysis; produce visuals (confusion matrix, feature importance).
- Inspect misclassified cases and summarize key patterns and failure modes.
- Draft the report (methods, results, discussion); prepare tables/figures and README checklist.

**W11**
- Final polish of the report; verify all plots/tables and citations.
- Submit report PDF and code archive on LMS/Canvas.
- Write team reflection and peer feedback notes.
- Submit group reflection (individual submission).

---

## Code of Conduct

- Respect differing views and opinions.
- Consider others’ viewpoints before final decisions.
- Respect values and principles of other members.
- Be mindful of emergencies or health issues.
- Actively participate in discussions.
- Be honest and accountable for assigned tasks (frequent updates, clear time expectations).
- Be flexible and reconfigure plans when appropriate.

---

## Disagreements or Non-Responsiveness

- A member will follow up to identify the problem, communicate concerns, empathize, and discuss solutions.
- If unresolved, escalate to class instructors.
- All members should act in good faith to resolve conflicts constructively.
